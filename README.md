# MLOps-Introduction---Personal-Notes
-MLOps refers to applying/integrating DevOps priciples to Machine Learning.
- 10% of the work here will be Machine  Learning and 90% will be engineering.
- The process goes like:
  DATA COLLECTION -> TRAINING THE MODEL -> DEPLOY IN PRODUCTION


 ** CASE STUDY**
Email Spam Detection(Scammers and hackers can find a new method of sending the spam emails different from the ones that are in the dataset)

Hackers now will change their strategy to fraud and this will force you to (re)collect and (re)train both the data and the model.
